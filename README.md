# Advent of Code 2019

Solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) exercises, implemented in JavaScript. These coding challenges can probably be done more elegantly and efficiently and there's no guarantee I'll even do all of them! Enjoy!

- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run the app with `node start 1-1`. The last parameter corresponds to the day and challenge for that day (there are two per day). IE: 1-1 is day 1, challenge 1.
- Run tests using `npm test`
